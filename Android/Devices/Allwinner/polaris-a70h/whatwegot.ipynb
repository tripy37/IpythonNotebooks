    "In this series of notebooks, i'm going to note the steps i have taken to investigate what damage OEM companies are able to do to  the android platform.  This was an attempt to find out what parts of the tablet or phone were tampered with by the company or individual befor being shipped to the end user.  Hopefully I may be able to find a solution to fix any damage done and try to reach a position of confidence that the original ROM can be considered free from any malicous code.\n",
